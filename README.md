# Quantifying Europe’s Cycling Infrastructure using OpenStreetMap (QECIO 2.0) 

There is great demand for data on cycling infrastructure, but currently, no official source provides this kind of information on a European scale. This data project responds to this need by extracting data about cycling infrastructure from OpenStreetMap (OSM). We generalised the methodology to cover most of Europe, took into account additional infrastructure types and provided additional statistics.

This project is the second edition of Quantifying Europe's Cycling Infrastructure using Open Street Map (QECIO 2.0.). To access the results from the previous edition click [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/81d2904d-7db5-4ed5-98e0-85af75b46577/page/p_qsvwe0yluc).
