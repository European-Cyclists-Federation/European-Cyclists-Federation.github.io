# Disclaimer

OpenStreetMap is a free, world-wide, crowdsourced geographic dataset. In certain contexts, OSM data has been found to be more detailed and up-to-date than official municipal data. However, OSM data is not perfect.
The data featured in this dashboard only represents OSM contributions. The lower numbers may therefore reflect missing OSM data rather than the actual absence of cycling infrastructure in a given area. Besides missing data, these numbers may not be fully representative in cases where OSM's thorough universal tagging guidelines do not account for certain local or informal cycling infrastructure types. Lastly, the data do not imply that the cycling infrastructure is necessarily high quality. To infer the cyclability of a given city's network, one needs to consider additional factors. As the OSM data coverage and completeness continues to improve, we are able to provide better and better estimations.
Since OSM is an open dataset, anyone can improve the accuracy of the database, and thus this dashboard, by adding or correcting OSM data.
