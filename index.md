There is a great demand for data on cycling infrastructure, but as for now, no official source provides this kind of information on a European scale. This data project responds to this need by extracting data about cycling infrastructure from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for 500+ European cities. We generalised the methodology to cover most of Europe, took into account additional infrastructure types and provided additional statistics.
